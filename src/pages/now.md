- Participating in a _Seeing Like A State_ reading group with some friends.
- Getting back into weight-lifting.
- Considering doing another blog re-design...

#### What is this page?

It's inspired by [NowNowNow](https://nownownow.com/about): "Think of what you'd tell a friend you hadn't seen in a year."
