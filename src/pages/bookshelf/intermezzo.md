## Review

This novel felt weightier and more melancholy than Rooney's previous works; I liked the poetic, fragmented effect of the prose.

_Just to hear that sound once again, he thinks. To feel that his life has been preserved somewhere and not forgotten, gathered around him, packed protectively around him still._
