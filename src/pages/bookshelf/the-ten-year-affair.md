## Review

I liked the premise of this novel: two alternate timelines, side by side, one in which Cora is faithful to her husband and one in which she has an affair with Sam. Disappointingly, I felt that the novel did nothing interesting with this setup. The takeaway seemed to be: real life is full of drudgery and boredom, fantasy life is exciting and romantic, and that’s just how it is.

_The world could not recognize gravitas. Every serious exchange was undermined by its particulars._
