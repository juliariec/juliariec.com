## Review 

I wasn't sure what this book would be, but by the end I was truly impressed by Klein's ability to pull together so many contemporary issues and find shared threads. I especially enjoyed the section about the Mirror World and how concerns that are brushed aside by dominant discourse are picked up elsewhere. 

  

 _The self as perfected brand, the self as digital avatar, the self as data mine, the self as idealized body, the self as racist and anti-Semitic projection, the child as mirror of the self, the self as eternal victim. These doubles share one thing in common: all are ways of not seeing._
