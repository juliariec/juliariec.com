## Review

<b>2nd read:</b> Rereading this resurrected parts of my brain I forgot existed. Everyone was more likable in the book than in the movie, and the pacing was surprisingly snappy. Fun to relive.

_Sometimes I wondered if I was seeing the same things through my eyes that the rest of the world was seeing through theirs. Maybe there was a glitch in my brain._
