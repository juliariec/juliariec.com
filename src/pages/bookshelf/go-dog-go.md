## Review

Rating this four stars as a compromise between my nephew's obsessive love for this book and my own protectiveness over my five star ratings.

This book has a lot of prepositions in it. Also, the words 'dog' and 'tree'. And a curious subplot with a hat critic, which I think should be a spinoff.

\_Do you like my hat?

I do not.\_
