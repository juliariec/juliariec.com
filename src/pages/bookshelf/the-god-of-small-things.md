## Review

This was a beautiful, devastating book. The descriptions and language of the twins' world were so striking; I also loved the narrative structure.

_But anger wasn't available to them and there was no face to put on this Other Thing that they held in their sticky Other Hands, like a imaginary orange. There was nowhere to lay it down. It wasn’t theirs to give away. It would have to be held. Carefully and forever._
