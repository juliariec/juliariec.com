## Review

I read this as a memoir rather than a how-to guide and found it inspiring and thought-provoking. More than anything, it felt like an illustration of how to reclaim and change your own life. I enjoyed the mixture of long-term changes and short-term tactics.

_To properly heal from addiction, we need a holistic approach. We need to create a life we don't need to escape._
