## Review

I loved the narrator's otherworldly voice and the slow progression of the story. It opened up a lot of existential questions for me without guiding me directly to them, which I appreciated.

_I wouldn't bother to leave a mound or sign indicating that the remains of a human being lay there. I would remember, and there was no one else to tell._
