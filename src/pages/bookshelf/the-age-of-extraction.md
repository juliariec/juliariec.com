## Review

I really enjoyed part one, which covered the rise of platforms and how they accumulate power. I had no major objections to the rest of the book, but it didn't feel as closely linked to the book's thesis.

Apparently Tim Wu and Cory Doctorow are long-time friends, and I think their books are fittingly complementary to each other. Extremely different vibes, but I understood each book more having read the other.

_We must see that the problems of technological and economic marginalization are entwined. Technology has never been neutral, but rather reflects ideology and what it is designed to do. Today’s great tech platforms are impressive, entertaining, and convenient, but also designed to be some of history’s most advanced tools for extracting wealth and resources from the broader economy. Consequently, as they become essential to everything, we are at risk of building an economy that is perpetually unfair for most of humanity._
