## Review 

I generally enjoy psychological novels, but this one felt too repetitive for my tastes. Mr Parkis was definitely the star of the story.  

  

 _And yet he was happier in his unused room simply because it was his: his possession. I thought with bitterness and envy: if one possesses a thing securely, one need never use it._
