## Review

I had a fun time reading this book and I loved the Irish dialogue. The main thing that bothered me is that I felt like Helen was the only narrator that had a proper character arc.

_"The reality of this place is that people here will turn a blind eye to every sort of horror for the sake of a quiet life."_
