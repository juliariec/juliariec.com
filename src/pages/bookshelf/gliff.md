## Review

This novel felt distinctive and crisp; the world and characters came together quickly and with surprising depth. I especially liked the playfulness of the language.

_Thrilling to me, the variety. Thrilling both to know and to not know, to be gifted possibilities, thrilling above all to see for myself the ways the words on the front of the school building might be related to words we used but at the same time weren't them._
