review: "This is a retelling of <i>Twilight</i> from Edward's perspective, and truly hits home that there's no believable way that Edward and Bella could fall in love. I think the strength of this novel is that it doesn't even try to convince the reader that their love makes any kind of sense, it just runs off into vampire lore, Cullen family dynamics, scenes where Edward is reading Alice's mind while she's having visions, a five page Q&A with Bella talking about plants in Arizona … you get the idea. It's really, really long, and Edward's inner monologue is really, really annoying. I wish this had been published when I was a teenager, because I think I probably would have enjoyed it then, but as an adult it was a bit alarming.<br/><br/><i>I compared the feelings, the ache and the soaring, to my life before Bella. I'd been so jaded, so world-weary, as if I'd experienced every emotion there was to be felt. What a fool. I'd barely sipped at the cup life had to offer. Only now was I aware of all I'd missed, and how much more I had to learn. So much suffering ahead, more than the joy, certainly. But the joy was so sweet and so strong that I would never forgive myself for missing a second of it.</i>"

## Review

This is a retelling of _Twilight_ from Edward's perspective, and truly hits home that there's no believable way that Edward and Bella could fall in love. I think the strength of this novel is that it doesn't even try to convince the reader that their love makes any kind of sense, it just runs off into vampire lore, Cullen family dynamics, scenes where Edward is reading Alice's mind while she's having visions, a five page Q&A with Bella talking about plants in Arizona … you get the idea. It's really, really long, and Edward's inner monologue is really, really annoying. I wish this had been published when I was a teenager, because I think I probably would have enjoyed it then, but as an adult it was a bit alarming.

_I compared the feelings, the ache and the soaring, to my life before Bella. I'd been so jaded, so world-weary, as if I'd experienced every emotion there was to be felt. What a fool. I'd barely sipped at the cup life had to offer. Only now was I aware of all I'd missed, and how much more I had to learn. So much suffering ahead, more than the joy, certainly. But the joy was so sweet and so strong that I would never forgive myself for missing a second of it._
