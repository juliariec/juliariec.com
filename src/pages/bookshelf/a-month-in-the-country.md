## Review

I enjoyed the beauty, simplicity, and quiet wit of this novel. A story about how men themselves change in the process of discovering others.

_Ah, those days… for many years afterwards their happiness haunted me. Sometimes, listening to music, I drift back and nothing has changed. The long end of summer. Day after day of warm weather, voices calling as night came on and lighted windows pricked the darkness and, at day-break, the murmur of corn and the warm smell of fields ripe for harvest. And being young._
