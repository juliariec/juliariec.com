## Review

I think this novel just wasn't for me, but I enjoyed getting a taste of a contemporary coming-of-age story.

_The sadness from the morning didn't exactly go away; it dried on me and slowly crumbled, leaving me covered in little flakes, like if you eat a glazed donut in a black shirt. That was how it was being a grown-up. We were all moving through the world like that, like those river dolphins that look pink only because they're so covered in scars._
