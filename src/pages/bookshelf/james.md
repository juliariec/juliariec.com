## Review

I've never read _The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn_, so I may not have been positioned well to enjoy this book. I felt like James was always at a distance; there was a lot of plot and very little emotion.

_I looked at one woman who might have been intrigued by me or taken with me, the entertainer. I saw the surface of her, merely the outer shell, and realized that she was mere surface all the way to her core._
