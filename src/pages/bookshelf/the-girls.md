## Review

I saw this book on a list somewhere and read it on a flight. I found the writing beautiful but the rest of the novel just didn't click for me.

_All that time I had spent readying myself, the articles that taught me life was really just a waiting room until someone noticed you—the boys had spent that time becoming themselves._
