## Review

I really enjoyed reading this book for what it was: Thiel's opinions on startups. It was punchy, easy to follow, and covered a few different facets of the business of tech startups.

_But in an indefinite world, people actually_ prefer _unlimited optionality; money is more valuable than anything you could possibly do with it._
