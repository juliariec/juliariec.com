## Review

This was my first time reading this novel, but I felt like I had already heard this story. I liked the tension and fragmentation of the narrative, and the way the world gradually began to take shape. I wish that the ending had more resolution; there were so many missing pieces of the story left undone.

_To be a man, watched by women. It must be entirely strange. To have them watching him all the time. To have them wondering, What’s he going to do next? … It must be just fine. It must be hell. It must be very silent._
