## Review

This book offered so many helpful frames for understanding my own relationships, and I think I've already recommended it to half a dozen friends. One of the key ideas is that relationships are like dances: you can't change what the other person does, but you can change your own steps, and as a result the dance will change.

_How easy it is to avoid this challenge of self-confrontation by keeping our emotional energy narrowly focused on men and children, just as society encourages us to do._
