## Review

This was an absolute delight; it made me want to read more, and it also convinced me that I should try writing again. Saunders engages with the stories in such a generative, insightful way, and his love for literature truly shines through. I've already been using multiple techniques from this book during my personal reading (like noticing my own questions as I read and thinking about why a specific passage might have been included) and it’s heightened my experience.

_We're always rationally explaining and articulating things. But we're at our most intelligent in the moment just before we start to explain or articulate. Great art occurs—or doesn't—in that instant._
