## Review

I was saddened by how much I disliked this book. The major issue for me was that Powers' writing style overshadowed any hope of the characters' interiority; it was far too omniscient and didactic to be compelling.

_The boy sits frozen by possibility. They can release any process they want into the world, any kind of willful thing. The only impossible thing is how to choose._

_His mother calls from the kitchen. ‘Teach it to cook the bhindi, please.’_
