## Review

I learned the most from part one of this book, "Developer Career Fundamentals". I felt as though many of the later parts were either review for me, or I lacked the context to understand them fully. This book would be great to read at the very beginning of a software engineering career, because it explains a lot about how tech companies work and provides a "lay of the land" for what to expect.
