## Review

I love a historical family saga, so I enjoyed the intertwining of family events with Chilean politics, Clara's premonitions, and the complicated relationships between Esteban and his family members. I found the novel a bit uneven, although that might have been intentional—the first half of the book felt much more focused and episodic, while the second half was tumultuous and expansive.

_Afterward she threw her paints and brushes into the trash and sat down to contemplate her drawings, which is to say, the history of her joys and sorrows. She decided that the balance had been happy and with a sigh said goodbye to the first stage of her life._
