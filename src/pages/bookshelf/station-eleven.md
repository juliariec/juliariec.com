## Review

This novel really hit home how fragile life is and how impossible it is to insulate yourself from disaster. A great story about resilience, community, and the power of art.

_The news had worsened. The fabric was unraveling. It will be hard to come back from this, he thought, because in those first days it was still inconceivable that civilization might not come back from this at all._
