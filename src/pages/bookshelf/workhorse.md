## Review

Reading this book was like watching a trainwreck, without the satisfying crunch at the end. I had fun reading it, but it was more enjoyable as a collection of scenes than a novel; it was too life-like, in that the threads of what could have been a story never cohered.

_What if New York doesn't build up, but rather it destroys? Every year, a million girls, just like me, move to New York City. We are the girls that believe success can only be attained via the harshest of training grounds. We are the girls that distrust things that come too easily, the girls who believe life, an interesting life, must be painfully earned. What they don't know—_ what I did not know _—is that if you are not careful, the path home can become overgrown. With a slowness nearly impossible to detect, there comes a point when you cannot find your way back and, so, your only choice is to move forward toward a destination utterly unknown._
