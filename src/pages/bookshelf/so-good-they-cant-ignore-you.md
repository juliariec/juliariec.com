## Review

This book makes a strong case for cultivating career capital to trade for autonomy and freedom; the constant re-iteration and overindexing on anecdotal evidence annoyed me by the end.

_Don't obsess over discovering your true calling. Instead, master rare and valuable skills. Once you build up the career capital that these skills generate, invest it wisely. Use it to acquire control over what you do and how you do it, and to identify and act on a life-changing mission._
