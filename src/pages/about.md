I'm Julia Rodenburg, the author and developer of this blog. I created this site in April 2021, but I've blogged sporadically on various platforms (Blogger, WordPress) since 2008.

I update my [/now](/now) page with what I'm up to. For the last three and a half years, I've been living in New York City and working as a software engineer; prior to that, I lived in Toronto.

### Interests

I love to read, socialize, and create things online. I also enjoy cooking, planning, walking, meditating, practicing yoga, writing, knitting, hosting, looking at art, and playing board games.

In the future, I'd like to be fluent in French and proficient in chess, playing piano, and swing dancing.
